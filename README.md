#### Using Roberta Model for Text Classification

This sample code includes detailed, step-by-step explanation about using Roberta for text classification. The data for this project was taken from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/data). 
In this code, we are training the model to identify if the cocument is disaster-related or no.

The code includes:
* information on preparing data for the format necessary for transformer models
* information on fine-tuning Roberta model
* information on train and validation loss to identify the most promising models
* information on misclassified documents
* confusion matrix
* classification report showing F1 score, precision and recall
* steps to save fine-tuned model and loading it after saving
* steps on using saved fine-tuned data on new, unseen documents
